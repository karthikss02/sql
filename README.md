## What is a Primary Key?

A column (or set of columns) whose values uniquely identify every row in a table.

### Why do we need a Primary Key?

Without a primary key, updating or deleting specific rows in a table becomes extremely difficult as there is no guaranteed safe way to refer to just the rows to be affected.

2. `COUNT()`
3. `MAX()`
